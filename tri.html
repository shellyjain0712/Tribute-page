      <h2>A Legacy of Nonviolence</h2>
      <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi, known as the Father of the Nation in India, was a pioneering leader whose philosophy of nonviolence 
        (Ahimsa) and truth (Satyagraha) reshaped the course of history. He believed that real strength lies not in physical force 
        but in the unwavering commitment to truth and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through his leadership, Gandhi spearheaded India's struggle for independence from British rule, using nonviolent resistance 
        as his most powerful weapon. He mobilized millions across India through peaceful protests, civil disobedience, and the 
        iconic Salt March, proving that change can be achieved without violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gandhi's teachings extend far beyond the borders of India. His ideas inspired civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. 
        and Nelson Mandela, proving that nonviolence and compassion are universal tools for addressing injustice and fostering unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, his legacy reminds us of the importance of humility, empathy, and standing firm for what is right, even in the face of 
        adversity. Gandhi's life is not just a chapter in history but a timeless guide for anyone seeking to create a better world.
